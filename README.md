# Password Maker

## Description

An application that generates random passwords based on criteria that the user has selected. Not every website will accept the standard randomly generated passwords created by my phone. I wanted to create a site that would help in situations when I need a random password that has unusual criteria. This will solve the dialemma I face when making a password for a website with very specific rules. I learned about planning my code before I create it.

## Usage

You click the red button and follow the pop-up prompts till it gives you the password.
